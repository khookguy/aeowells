   Dear {{{Program_Membership__c.Member_First_Name__c}}},&nbsp; 
  <br /> 
  <br /> Thank you for taking the time to complete the Business Health Assessment. We have analyzed your responses to the questions and produced personalized recommendations to support your engagement on RESILI and the growth of your business.&nbsp; 
  <br /> &nbsp; 
  <ol> 
   <li>Personalized Learning Plan: <a href="https://resili.aeoworks.org/my-profile">Log in</a>&nbsp;to your RESILI account to access your personalized learning plan with recommended courses to get you started on the platform. As new courses become available, you’ll find new personalized recommendations on your Profile page. &nbsp;</li> 
   <li>Personalized Business Insights: Use <a href="https://quickview.walkerinfo.com/?SID={{{Program_Membership__c.BHA_Survey_ID__c}}}&amp;R={{{Program_Membership__c.BHA_Survey_Response_ID__c}}}">this link</a> to view your personalized business recommendations.

For easier access, this link has also been included in your RESILI Profile Page. &nbsp;</li> 
   <li>Request a Coaching Session: In your Profile Page, you’ll also be able to request a meeting with a trained coach to review your Business Health Assessment, your Personalized Business Insights, and provide additional guidance on how to proceed with your business. During this 1 hour meeting, you’ll be able to ask questions and receive live guidance. At the end of this session, you’ll receive a “Business Snapshot” that provides a roadmap on what strategies to implement to ensure business success over the next 12 months. &nbsp;</li>
